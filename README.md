Solar Powered Electricity Grids-Modelling to  mitigate the ‘Duck-Curve’


Abstract—Renewable energy is being increasingly incorporated in our city power grids. This not only reduces the dependence on fossil fuels but also lowers the carbon emissions. However, there is a need to address how to incorporate renewable energy in an efficient manner and reduce power losses and infrastructural damage. This paper proposes an ensemble method for solar power prediction. Solar output power usually has a complex and nonlinear characteristic due to intermittent and time varying behaviour of solar irradiance. So different machine learning models have been applied to best predict solar power generation and to mitigate the ‘Duck Curve’. The following machine learning models were implemented on the selected dataset: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Regression and Neural network. Linear Regression showed a very high variance, so we started training with other models. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of SVR was 0.403 after tuning and for Decision tree was 0.04 after hyperparameter tuning. The Neural Networks showed the least error of all the models amounting to 0.0134.
